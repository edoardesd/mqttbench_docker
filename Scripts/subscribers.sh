# For the test, we shall use 4 subscribers and 4 publishers, grouped by 2 in different brokers, all of which will will be subscribed/publish at the same topic. More precisely, we will subscribe 2 clients in broker 1 and 2 other clients in broker 2. In addition, other 4 publish-clients will publish 2 in broker 3 and 2 in broker 4. Broker 5 doesn't have any client.


# Subscriber ip assignement:
# sub_1 -> 172.20.0.21 -> subscribed hivemq 172.20.0.2

# sub_4 -> 172.20.0.32 -> subscribed hivemq 172.20.0.3

# This strategy doesn't work with subscribers, since they remain active, so what can be done in that case is to fetch the debug stream after we have finished running the network, just before killing the running processes.
